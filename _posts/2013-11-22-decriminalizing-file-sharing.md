Frustrated at the complexity faced by DJs, libraries, schools, and tech companies using or permitting sharing of any cultural material, several members of the European Parliament sent a [letter](http://www.marietjeschaake.eu/2012/12/letter-to-president-barroso-on-the-need-for-copyright-reform/) to the President of the European Commission asking him to consider relaxing over-restrictive copyright laws. However, they never recieved a reply about these pressing issues.

Under existing regulations, anyone wishing to share or build upon content must worry about whether or not they are infringing on someone's copyright. A growing amount of work is suffering from "culture rot", by which it is no longer used by its copyright holders, but also has not been released into the public domain. This means that TV shows, movies, music, and other important pieces of culture are sitting in storage facilities, unable to be enjoyed.

To right the situation, European Parliament Members [Amelia Andersdotter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Andersdotter), [Marietje Schaake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marietje_Schaake), and [Pawe≈Ç Zalewski](http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawe%C5%82_Zalewski) held an event called [Copyright & Research and Innovation Policy: The Case of Text and Data Mining](http://copyright4creativity.eu/2013/10/29/the-case-of-text-and-data-mining-12-nov-2013-european-parliament-brussels/). The event discussed many things, but one idea that was presented was the decriminalization of file sharing. Such a move would be a boon for many businesses and cultural institutions, and would allow culture and innovation to move forward.

A recorded stream of the event [is available to watch](http://eventstream.streamovations.be/copyright-research-and-innovation-policy.php).
