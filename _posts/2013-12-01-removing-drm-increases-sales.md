A study titled [Intellectual Property Strategy and the Long Tail: Evidence from the Recorded Music Industry ![PDF](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/icons/search/fugue/icons/document-pdf.png)](http://inside.rotman.utoronto.ca/laurinazhang/files/2013/11/laurina_zhang_jmp_nov4.pdf) concludes that abandoning DRM (Digital Rights Management) boosts music sales by 10% on average, and 30% in some cases. The study takes advantage of the fact that four major record labels removed DRM from their released music between 2007 and 2009, offering an opportunity to directly study the effects of unfettered music.

Researcher [Laurina Zhang](http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/Degrees/PhD/PhDStudentBios/Zhang%20Laurina.aspx) followed a sample of nearly 6,000 albums over the period in question. Adjusted for factors such as release date and genre, her data demonstrates that, overall, album sales increased after the restrictions were lifted. Sales increased by an average of 10%, and lesser-known albums experienced a boost of up to 30%. The most popular albums did not experience any measurable benefit. Zhang attributes this imbalance to the fact that removing DRM aids in discovery of new media.
